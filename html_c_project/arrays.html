<pre style="font-size: 150% ">
Arrays a kind of data structure that can store a fixed-size sequential collection of elements
 of the same type. An array is used to store a collection of data, but it is often more useful
  to think of an array as a collection of variables of the same type.


Instead of declaring individual variables, such as number0, number1, ..., and number99, you 
declare one array variable such as numbers and use numbers[0], numbers[1], and ..., numbers[99]
 to represent individual variables. A specific element in an array is accessed by an index.


All arrays consist of contiguous memory locations. The lowest address corresponds to the first 
element and the highest address to the last element.


Arrays in C
Declaring Arrays
To declare an array in C, a programmer specifies the type of the elements and the number of 
elements required by an array as follows âˆ’


type arrayName [ arraySize ];
This is called a single-dimensional array. The arraySize must be an integer constant greater than
 zero and type can be any valid C data type. For example, to declare a 10-element array called 
 balance of type double, use this statement âˆ’


double balance[10];
Here balance is a variable array which is sufficient to hold up to 10 double numbers.


Initializing Arrays
You can initialize an array in C either one by one or using a single statement as follows âˆ’


double balance[5] = {1000.0, 2.0, 3.4, 7.0, 50.0};
The number of values between braces { } cannot be larger than the number of elements that we declare
 for the array between square brackets [ ].


If you omit the size of the array, an array just big enough to hold the initialization is created. 
Therefore, if you write âˆ’


double balance[] = {1000.0, 2.0, 3.4, 7.0, 50.0};
You will create exactly the same array as you did in the previous example. Following is an example 
to assign a single element of the array âˆ’


balance[4] = 50.0;
The above statement assigns the 5th element in the array with a value of 50.0. All arrays have 0 as 
the index of their first element which is also called the base index and the last index of an array will
 be total size of the array minus 1. Shown below is the pictorial representation of the array we discussed
  above âˆ’


Array Presentation
Accessing Array Elements
An element is accessed by indexing the array name. This is done by placing the index of the element within
 square brackets after the name of the array. For example âˆ’


double salary = balance[9];
The above statement will take the 10th element from the array and assign the value to salary variable.
