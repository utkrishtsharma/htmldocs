<pre style="font-size: 150% ">
   It is a robust language with rich set of built-in functions
   and operators that can be used to write any complex program.
   The C compiler combines the capabilities of an assembly language
   with features of a high-level language. Programs Written in 
   C are efficient and fast. This is due to its variety of data 
   type and powerful operators. It is many time faster than BASIC.
   C is highly portable this means that programs once written can 
   be run on another machines with little or no modification. 
   Another important feature of C program, is its ability to extend 
   itself. A C program is basically a collection of functions that
   are supported by C library. We can also create our own function
   and add it to C library. C language is the most widely used 
   language in operating systems and embedded system development today.
