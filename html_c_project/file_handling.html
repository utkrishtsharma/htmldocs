It will contain the data even after program exit. Normally we use variable or array to store data, but data is lost after program exit. Variables and arrays are non-permanent storage medium whereas file is permanent storage medium.

Functions for file handling There are many functions in C library to open, read, write, search and close file. A list of file functions are given below:

No. Function    Description

2   fprintf()   write data into file
3   fscanf()    reads data from file
4   fputc() writes a character into file
5   fgetc() reads a character from file
6   fclose()    closes the file
7   fseek() sets the file pointer to given position
8   fputw() writes an integer to file
9   fgetw() reads an integer from file
10  ftell() returns current position
11  rewind()    sets the file pointer to the beginning of the file
Opening File: fopen()
The fopen() function is used to open a file. The syntax of fopen() function is given below:

FILE *fopen( const char * filename, const char * mode );

w   opens a text file in write mode
a   opens a text file in append mode
r+  opens a text file in read and write mode
w+  opens a text file in read and write mode
a+  opens a text file in read and write mode
rb  opens a binary file in read mode
wb  opens a binary file in write mode
ab  opens a binary file in append mode
rb+ opens a binary file in read and write mode
wb+ opens a binary file in read and write mode
