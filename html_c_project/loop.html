<pre style="font-size: 150% ">
    You may encounter situations, when a block of code needs to be executed several number of times.
     In general, statements are executed sequentially: The first statement in a function is executed 
     first, followed by the second, and so on.

Programming languages provide various control structures that allow for more complicated execution paths.

A loop statement allows us to execute a statement or group of statements multiple times. Given below is 
the general form of a loop statement in most of the programming languages âˆ’

Loop Architecture C programming language provides the following types of loops to handle looping requirements.

Sr.No.  Loop Type & Description 1   while loop Repeats a statement or group of statements while a given 
condition is true. It tests the condition before executing the loop body.

2   for loop Executes a sequence of statements multiple times and abbreviates the code that manages the 
loop variable.

3   do...while loop It is more like a while statement, except that it tests the condition at the end of 
the loop body.

Loop Control Statements Loop control statements change execution from its normal sequence. When execution 
leaves a scope, all automatic objects that were created in that scope are destroyed.

C supports the following control statements.

Sr.No.  Control Statement & Description 1   break statement Terminates the loop or switch statement and transfers
 execution to the statement immediately following the loop or switch.

2   continue statement Causes the loop to skip the remainder of its body and immediately retest its condition prior
 to reiterating.

3   goto statement Transfers control to the labeled statement.

The Infinite Loop A loop becomes an infinite loop if a condition never becomes false. The for loop is traditionally 
used for this purpose. Since none of the three expressions that form the 'for' loop are required, you can make an 
endless loop by leaving the conditional expression empty.

 A for loop is a repetition control structure that allows you to efficiently write a loop that needs to execute 
 a specific number of times.

Syntax The syntax of a for loop in C programming language is âˆ’

for ( init; condition; increment ) { statement(s); }

Here is the flow of control in a 'for' loop âˆ’

The init step is executed first, and only once. This step allows you to declare and initialize any loop control 
variables. You are not required to put a statement here, as long as a semicolon appears.

Next, the condition is evaluated. If it is true, the body of the loop is executed. If it is false, the body of the 
loop does not execute and the flow of control jumps to the next statement just after the 'for' loop.

After the body of the 'for' loop executes, the flow of control jumps back up to the increment statement. This statement 
allows you to update any loop control variables. This statement can be left blank, as long as a semicolon appears after the
 condition.

The condition is now evaluated again. If it is true, the loop executes and the process repeats itself (body of loop, then 
increment step, and then again condition). After the condition becomes false, the 'for' loop terminates.

     <pre style="font-size: 150% ">
    A while loop in C programming repeatedly executes a target statement as long as a given condition is true.

Syntax The syntax of a while loop in C programming language is âˆ’

while(condition) { statement(s); }

Here, statement(s) may be a single statement or a block of statements. The condition may be any expression, and true 
is any nonzero value. The loop iterates while the condition is true.

When the condition becomes false, the program control passes to the line immediately following the loop.

<h3 style="text-align:center ; font-size: 200% ">Do While Loop</h3>
 <pre style="font-size: 150% ">
    Unlike for and while loops, which test the loop condition at the top of the loop, the do...while loop in C 
    programming checks its condition at the bottom of the loop.

A do...while loop is similar to a while loop, except the fact that it is guaranteed to execute at least one time.

Syntax The syntax of a do...while loop in C programming language is âˆ’

do { statement(s); } while( condition );

Notice that the conditional expression appears at the end of the loop, so the statement(s) in the loop executes once
 before the condition is tested.

If the condition is true, the flow of control jumps back up to do, and the statement(s) in the loop executes again. 
This process repeats until the given condition becomes false.
