<h3 style="font-size: 250% ">Why C is so popular ?</h3>

<pre>
 <ul style="list-style-type:disc ;font-size: 150%">
 <li>
 C is ubiquitous. Whatever the platform, C is probably available.
 C is portable. Write a piece of clean C, and it compiles with minimal 
 modifications on other platforms - sometimes it even works out-of-the-box.
 </li>
 <li>
C has been around for a while. Back in the days when UNIX conquered the world,
 C (the UNIX programming language of choice) shared in its world domination, 
and became the lingua franca of the programming world. Any serious programmer
 can be expected to at least make some sense of a chunk of C; the same can't be 
said about most other languages.</li>
<li>
C is still the default language for UNIX and UNIX-flavored systems. If you want a 
library to succeed in open-source land, you need fairly good reasons not to use C. 
This is partially due to tradition, but more because C is the only language you can
 safely assume to be supported on any UNIX-like system. Writing your library in C means 
you can minimize dependencies.</li><li>
C is simple. It lacks the expressivity of sophisticated OOP or functional languages, 
but its simplicity means it can be picked up quickly.</li>
<li>
C is versatile. It is suitable for embedded systems, device drivers, OS kernels,
 small command-line utilities, large desktop applications, DBMS's, implementing 
other programming languages, and pretty much anything else you can think of.</li>
<li>
C is fast. Most C implementations compile directly to machine code, and the programmer 
has full power over what happens at the machine level. There is no interpreter, no JIT 
compiler, no VM or runtime - just the code, a compiler, a linker, and the bare metal.</li>
<li>
C is 'free' (in both the beer and the speech sense). There is no single company that owns
 and controls the standard, there are several implementations to choose from, there are
  no copyright, patenting or trademark issues for using C, and some of the best implementations
   are open-source.</li> 
<li>
C has a lot of momentum going. The language has been popular for decades, so there is 
an enormous amount of applications, libraries, tools, and most of all, communities, to
 support the language.</li>
<li>
C is mature. The last standard that introduced big changes is C99, and it is mostly b
ackwards-compatible with previous standards. Unlike newer languages (say, Python), you 
don't have to worry about breaking changes anytime soon.</li> 
<li>
C is compatible. Most languages have bindings to talk to C. This means one can develop a 
library in C using standard calling conventions, and feel confident that almost any other
 language can link against that library. To name a few popular languages in widespread 
use: C#, Java, Perl, Python, PHP can all link against C libraries without much trouble.</li>
<li>
C is powerful: if the language cannot do something, all popular compilers allow embedding 
assembler code which can do anything the hardware can do. Transitively combined with the above 
point about compatibility, this means C can act as a liaison between higher level languages 
and the "bare metal" of assembly.
