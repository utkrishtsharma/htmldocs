The types in C can be classified as follows âˆ’

Sr.No.  Types & Description 1

Basic Types

They are arithmetic types and are further classified into: (a) integer types and (b) floating-point types.

2   Enumerated types

They are again arithmetic types and they are used to define variables that can only assign certain discrete integer values throughout the program.

3   The type void

The type specifier void indicates that no value is available.

4   Derived types

They include (a) Pointer types, (b) Array types, (c) Structure types, (d) Union types and (e) Function types.

The array types and structure types are referred collectively as the aggregate types. The type of a function specifies the type of the function's return value. We will see the basic types in the following section, where as other types will be covered in the upcoming chapters.

Integer Types The following table provides the details of standard integer types with their storage sizes and value ranges âˆ’

Type    Storage size    Value range
char    1 byte  -128 to 127 or 0 to 255
unsigned char   1 byte  0 to 255
signed char 1 byte  -128 to 127
int 2 or 4 bytes    -32,768 to 32,767 or -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647
unsigned int    2 or 4 bytes    0 to 65,535 or 0 to 4,294,967,295
short   2 bytes -32,768 to 32,767
unsigned short  2 bytes 0 to 65,535
long    4 bytes -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647
unsigned long   4 bytes 0 to 4,294,967,295
To get the exact size of a type or a variable on a particular platform, you can use the sizeof operator. The expressions sizeof(type) yields the storage size of the object or type in bytes.
